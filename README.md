# Inventory-Tracker
Tracking items remaining in inventory based on sales of products
By submitting quantity and names of items sold of dishes for a restaraunt, I would like to know how many ingredients are left in my inventory. The names of the dishes should have an internal list of ingredients it takes to make, deduct that from existing inventory, to have a final tally of the remainder of ingredients left in storage. 
The purpose is to be able to look at the inventory every week, and know what to purchase to restock. This should also include the containters that are used for each dish.
